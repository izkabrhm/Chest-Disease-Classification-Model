# Chest-Disease-Classification-Model
A deep learning model has been implemented to inspect X Ray images of human chests and classify whether the chests are healthy or are infected with diseases such as Covid-19, Viral Pneumonia or Bacterial Pneumonia.

Chest diseases are very serious health problems in the life of people. These diseases include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pneumonia, asthma, tuberculosis, and lung diseases. The timely diagnosis of chest diseases is very important. Many methods have been developed for this purpose.

In this project, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are presented for the diagnosis of chest diseases. The architecture of CNN and its design principle are presented. THe ResNet50 which had shown previous success with earlier classification problems has been used here.
